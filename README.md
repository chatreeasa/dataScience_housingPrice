  <h1>California Housing Prices - Linear Regression Project</h1>

  <p>This project applies linear regression to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing Prices dataset.</p>

  <h2>Concept</h2>

  <p>The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict the median house value based on various features such as population, median income, and location.</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Load the dataset using pandas.</li>
    <li>Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.</li>
    <li>Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling.</li>
    <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
    <li>Create a linear regression model and train it using the training set.</li>
    <li>Make predictions on the testing set.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error.</li>
    <li>Visualize the predicted values against the actual values to analyze the model's performance.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>This project utilizes the California Housing Prices dataset to build a linear regression model for predicting housing prices. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and performing feature scaling. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated using mean squared error and mean absolute error. The performance of the model is visualized by comparing the predicted values against the actual values. This project serves as an example of using linear regression for predicting housing prices and demonstrates the steps involved in developing such a model.</p>
